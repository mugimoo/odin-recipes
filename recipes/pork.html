        <img src="pork.webp">

        <p>Pork tenderloin with apples and onions is an easy, tasty main dish for the family on a weeknight. While the pork roasts in the oven, steam a veggie side and prepare a quick salad.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 (1 1/2 pound) pork tenderloins</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sea salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided, or more as needed</li>
            <li>3 medium Granny Smith apples - peeled, cored, and sliced into eighths</li>
            <li>2 medium sweet onions, sliced vertically</li>
            <li>3 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme, divided</li>
            <li>Â¼ teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>1 cup chicken stock</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Trim silver skin from pork tenderloins; pat dry using paper towels. Rub 2 teaspoons vegetable oil over tenderloins, then rub with sea salt.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a large, oven-proof skillet over medium heat until it shimmers. Cook tenderloins in hot oil, rotating to brown all sides, about 10 minutes. Transfer pork to a large plate.</li>
            <li>Add remaining 1 tablespoon vegetable oil to any drippings in the skillet. Cook apples and onions in hot oil, stirring occasionally, until onions turn translucent, about 5 minutes; add more oil if the skillet gets dry. Season with 1 teaspoon thyme and black pepper; stir gently to combine. Remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Use a pastry brush to spread Dijon mustard evenly over tenderloins. Sprinkle with remaining 2 teaspoons thyme. Nestle tenderloins into the skillet with apple mixture.</li>
            <li>Roast, uncovered, in the preheated oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of tenderloins reads at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), about 15 minutes. Remove the skillet from the oven and transfer pork to a large platter. Cover with aluminum foil and let rest.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, pour chicken stock into a saucepan and cook over medium-high heat until reduced by half, 8 to 10 minutes. Pour into the skillet with apple mixture. Cook over medium-high heat until boiling, about 5 minutes; stir in butter until melted.</li>
            <li>Slice pork and serve over apple mixture.</li>
        </ol>
